# Machine-Learning-Project

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the presence or absence of Parkinson's disease based on biomedical voice measurements. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement, with symptoms including tremors, stiffness, and impaired balance. Early detection is crucial for effective management and treatment.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of biomedical voice measurements collected from individuals with and without Parkinson's disease. These measurements, obtained from sustained phonations, include various acoustic features.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, scale features, and potentially engineer new features for improved model performance.

2. **Feature Selection**: Relevant features are selected to build robust predictive models. Techniques such as correlation analysis and feature importance are employed to identify the most informative features.

3. **Model Selection**: Several machine learning algorithms are evaluated and compared to identify the best-performing model. Algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc., are considered.

4. **Model Training**: The selected model is trained on the preprocessed dataset using techniques such as cross-validation to ensure generalizability and minimize overfitting.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in predicting Parkinson's disease.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Model hyperparameters are tuned using techniques such as grid search or random search to optimize model performance further.

7. **Model Validation**: The final model is validated on unseen data to ensure its reliability and generalization ability.

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate more advanced feature engineering techniques to extract additional insights from the voice measurements.
- Explore ensemble learning methods to combine the predictions of multiple models for improved accuracy.
- Develop a web-based application or API for easy deployment and accessibility of the predictive model.
- Enhance the model's interpretability by employing techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations).
- Collect and incorporate additional data sources, such as demographic information or medical history, to enhance the predictive power of the model.
